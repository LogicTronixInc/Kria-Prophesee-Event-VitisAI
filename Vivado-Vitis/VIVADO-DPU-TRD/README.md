# VIVADO-DPU-TRD for Kria-Petalinux for Prophesee MIPI Camera based ML application

This files and resources are for creating "Prophesee MIPI Pipeline + DPU" based VIVADO design. This approach is used for KR260 Petalinux boot flow. \

**While we have used "Vitis flow" of DPU+MIPI design in KR260-Ubuntu which is final app.**\
