# VIVADO-DPU-TRD for Kria-Petalinux for Prophesee MIPI Camera based ML application

This files and resources are for creating "Prophesee MIPI Pipeline + DPU" based VIVADO design. This approach is used for KR260 Petalinux boot flow. 

*Note this VIVADO design flow uses Prophesee IP cores for VIVADO which manages the event streams with DMA IP. You have to contact Prophesee for those IP Cores! Prophesee provides those IP cores with Apache2 Licensing!*

In this directory we are providing:
1. Tcl File for re-creating the Prophesee MIPI + DPU Design in VIVADO 2022.2 version.
2. Generated XSA file, ready to use in Petalinux 2022.2 version.
3. Block Design - PDF

**While we have used "Vitis flow" of DPU+MIPI design in KR260-Ubuntu which is final app.**
