# Yolov4-tiny Tensorflow Quantization and Compilation
We are training Yolov4-tiny in Tensorflow2 GPU environment and after training we are converting it into Tensorflow1 based model (.pb).\

Tensorflow2 dependencies can be found at "requirements.txt".\

We are using Vitis AI 3.0 for Quantizing the tensorflow1 model (.pb) model.\

1. **Quantization**
Quantization script,\
- after quantization you will get xmodel and .pb model.

2. **Compilation**
Compilation Script, now compile the quantized xmodel.

After compilation you will receive the XMODEL.
