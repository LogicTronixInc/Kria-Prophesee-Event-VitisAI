# Vitis AI and ML directory

In this directory we are having Yolov7 and Yolov4-tiny ML models, training scripts in GPU, Quantization/Compilation scripts for Vitis AI and then Kria-KV260 Board inference scripts. \

1. **Yolov7**
In yolov7 , we have the training GPU script of yolov7, quantization/compilation and board inference scripts. \

2. **Yolov4-tiny**
We also have created Yolov4-tiny based Vitis AI resource for this Prophesee event ML application. In yolov4-tiny we have the necessary codes/scripts for training, quantization/compilation and board inference.

3. **Dataset** 
We have used eTRAM Dataset for larger training in event dataset. \
More details of eTRAM dataset can be found at: https://eventbasedvision.github.io/eTraM/
